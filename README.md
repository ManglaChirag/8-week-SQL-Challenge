# :dart: 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains the solution for the 8 case studies in **[#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)** By **[Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/)**.

These case-studies are very practical and resembles real world use cases. Starting from ground-up these are some of the best and well thought problems i've come accross. Each case study contains a dataset with a series of questions to practice your SQL skills

I've used **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** and **[pgAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/)** to write these queries.
